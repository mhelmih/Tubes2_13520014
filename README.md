# Folder Crawling
> This project is a GUI-based application which model the features of file explorer program of operating system using BFS and DFS algorithm. This feature is implemented with folder crawling technique, where the computer engine will start
search for files that match the query starting from the starting directory to all children of
the starting directory until the first file/all files are found or no files are found. Search results will be visualized in the form of tree graph.
